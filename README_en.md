## ‚ö†Ô∏è Required folder for Wallpaper Engine integration

```
/home/[your_user]/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/workshop/content/431960/
```

  Your browser does not support the video tag.

This folder is automatically created by Steam when you install and use Wallpaper Engine. If it does not exist, Swengine will not be able to import wallpapers from Wallpaper Engine.

## üÜï Recent Updates

- **Full support for the MPVPAPER backend:** Use videos as animated wallpapers with low CPU usage.
- **Automatic switching between SWWW and MPVPAPER:** Applying a wallpaper kills previous processes from the other backend to avoid conflicts.
- **Automatic startup of swww-daemon:** If not running when applying a wallpaper with SWWW, it will be started automatically.
- **Optimized mpvpaper arguments:** Adjusted for lower CPU and RAM usage.
- **Better UX:** Notifications and dialogs now work correctly with persistent wallpapers (mpvpaper).

Check the documentation for updated details and recommendations for each backend.
